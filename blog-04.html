    <h1>Blog post for September 23th, 2021</h1>

    <p>This week will be a very short week as I have two projects due for two other Computer Science courses this week. 
        I chose an article from the W3 school talking about pseudo-elements. The link to the website I used can be accessed<a
            href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_elements.asp">here.</a></p>
    <p>
        The article talks about a lot of cool and interesting things you can do with paragraphs or lists in CSS. 
        The coolest thing shown in the article was the ::first-line tag which allows you to edit just the first line of every paragraph, 
        however you want, as demonstrated in this paragraph. One of the weirder things also mentioned was the ::last-child tag which allows 
        you to edit the last paragraph tag and when they have a ::nth-child() tag which will let you edit any paragraph tag from 1-n. 
        Another cool thing was the ::marker tag which lets you change the color of html list items.
    </p>

    <p>Below is the sample code to make an image ripple as well as an example:</p>
    <pre>
        <code class="language-CSS">
            p::first-line {
                background-color: yellow;
              }
        </code>
    </pre>
