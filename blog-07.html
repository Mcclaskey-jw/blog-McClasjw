    <h1>Blog post for November 4th, 2021</h1>

    <p>This week I as we are starting our section on react I wanted to do some additional reading on some of the basics
        of reacts.
        I chose an article from the W3 school talking about react basics such as conditional variables and forms.
        The link to the website I used can be accessed <a
            href="https://www.w3schools.com/REACT/react_conditional_rendering.asp">here</a> and
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/REACT/react_forms.asp">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The article shows a few different ways you can use conditionals in your react function.
        The first shown is a simple example where you pass the condition true or false as a prop to the function and do
        simple JavaScript conditionals to update appropriatly.
        The second and more interesting to me personally is the adding of a logical operator in the example it was &&.
        I found it interesting that you can logically compare a string which I assume is just always true.
        The article never discusses the OR (||) logical operator, but I assume it is not useful or just redundant.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second article about forms I wanted to read as well because it will be helpful for my Porject 3.
        The article showed me how to properly get and store the value of any inputed text and save it into an array.
        I also found it extremly helpful how they expplained what useState was and how to properly use the function
        call.
        I also liked there example where they did some error handling by using the conditional OR variable (guess it is
        important).

    <p>Below is the sample of code from the forms article:</p>
    <pre>
        <code class="JavaScript">
            import { useState } from "react";
            import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

            function MyForm() {
                const [inputs, setInputs] = useState({});

                const handleChange = (event) => {
                const name = event.target.name;
                const value = event.target.value;
                setInputs(values => ({...values, [name]: value}))
                        }

            const handleSubmit = (event) => {
                event.preventDefault();
                alert(inputs);
            }

            return (
            </code>
            <code class="html">
            <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
                <label>Enter your name:
                    <input 
                        type="text" 
                        name="username" 
                        value={inputs.username || ""} 
                        onChange={handleChange}
                />
                </label>
                <label>Enter your age:
                    <input 
                        type="number" 
                        name="age" 
                        value={inputs.age || ""} 
                        onChange={handleChange}
                    />
                </label>
                <input type="submit" />
            </form>
        </code>
        <code class = "JavaScript">
            )
            }

            ReactDOM.render(<MyForm />, document.getElementById('root'));
        </code>
    </pre>
