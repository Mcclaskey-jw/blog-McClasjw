    <h1>Blog post for November 11th, 2021</h1>

    <p>This week I as we are still working with react but going past a simple useState I wanted to read up on redux.
        As I usually do, I looked at an article from the w3school.
        The link to the website I used can be accessed 
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/REACT/react_usereducer.asp">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The useReducer is as i have read similar to the reading and redux, where you can keep track of multiple states with one state instead of having multiple like in Lab 19.
        UseReducer has a similar setup to useState, but instead of having the one initial state, you also pass a reducer object and initial state.
        Sadly the article does not have a lot of explaination for the code and why they are doing what they are doing, but 
        as I am slowly understanding from the code given is that when somthing in the App (Todos in the code) the onChange field we call a fucntion handleComplete which passes arguments to our reducer function.
        The reducer funciton handles a set of actions that will need to take place or the lack of change if nothing is changing.

    <p>Below is the sample of code from the forms article:</p>
    <pre>
        <code class="JavaScript">
            const reducer = (state, action) => {
                switch (action.type) {
                  case "COMPLETE":
                    return state.map((todo) => {
                      if (todo.id === action.id) {
                        return { ...todo, complete: !todo.complete };
                      } else {
                        return todo;
                      }
                    });
                  default:
                    return state;
                }
              };
              
              function Todos() {
                const [todos, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialTodos);
              
                const handleComplete = (todo) => {
                  dispatch({ type: "COMPLETE", id: todo.id });
                };
              
                return (
        </code> <code class= "html">
                  <>
                    {todos.map((todo) => (
                      <div key={todo.id}>
                        <label>
                          <input
                            type="checkbox"
                            checked={todo.complete}
                            onChange={() => handleComplete(todo)}
                          />
                          {todo.title}
                        </label>
                      </div>
                    ))}
                  </>
                </code>
                <code class="JavaScript">
                );
              }
              
              ReactDOM.render(<Todos />, document.getElementById('root'));
