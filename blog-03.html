    <h1>Blog post for September 10th, 2021</h1>

    <p>This week we continued to hone our skills in CSS and work on our ability to manipulate divs with flex. This blog
        I wanted to go back to learn more about image manipulation with CSS. I found a very helpful w3schoolssite that shows a bunch of cool effects you can do with CSS found <a
            href-"https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_images.asp">here.</a>

        This is a very helpful article that shows some new (too me) effects you can add to images with CSS. Some
        of the styles they demonstrated are about changing the opacity, making effects happen over images as you hover over them, and grey
        scaling or inverting the color of the image. The coolest one that they showed was an image being inverted when hovering over the image.

    <p>Below is the sample code to make an image ripple as well as an example:</p>
    <pre>
        <code class="language-CSS">
            img:hover {
                transform: scaleX(-1);
              }
        </code>
