    <h1>Blog post for October 7th, 2021</h1>

    <p>This week I just learned about JavaScript and wanted to learn more or at least get a better understanding of the language. 
        I chose an article from the W3 school talking about the JavaScript basics. The link to the website I used can be accessed<a
            href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_examples.asp">here.</a></p>
    <p>
        The article contains many different links to simple concepts you can do in JavaScript. 
        The first section on the page links to pages talking about how to change and access differnt elements in HTML and CSS. 
        The next section is about creating simple JavaScript function that let change or manipulate content on the screen.
        The final section I reviewed was about how to send an output to the console using JavaScript. 
    </p>

    <p>Below is the sample code to send information to the console:</p>
    <pre>
        <code class="JavaScript">
            console.log("Hello World");
        </code>
    </pre>
