    <h1>Blog post for September 10th, 2021</h1>

    <p>This week we started learning about CSS and the basic styling tools we can use to have PRETTY text on our
        webpages.
        Which is why I did a simple google search for “cool simple things to do in HTML with CSS” you can look at the
        website <a href-"https://www.freelancer.com/articles/web-development/css-tips-and-tricks">here.</a>

        The article does go into some crazy advanced (or seem very advanced to me right now) with a ::before and ::after
        attributes in CSS which can give you the ability to add tooltips and other cool effects on text like the
        typewriter
        effect. They also had two points about some helpful formatting for images and other divs with the calc()
        function
        and position fixing. They also have section on attr() field in CSS but I am still confused on what exactly it
        does
        after reading there example page.
    </p>

    <p>This is the CSS code <a href-"https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/typewriter-effect/">they</a> use to get the
        typewriter effect.</p>
    <pre>
        <code class="language-CSS">
        .typewriter h1 {
            overflow: hidden; /* Ensures the content is not revealed until the animation */
            border-right: .15em solid orange; /* The typwriter cursor */
            white-space: nowrap; /* Keeps the content on a single line */
            margin: 0 auto; /* Gives that scrolling effect as the typing happens */
            letter-spacing: .15em; /* Adjust as needed */
            animation: 
              typing 3.5s steps(40, end),
              blink-caret .75s step-end infinite;
          }
          
          /* The typing effect */
          @keyframes typing {
            from { width: 0 }
            to { width: 100% }
          }
          
          /* The typewriter cursor effect */
          @keyframes blink-caret {
            from, to { border-color: transparent }
            50% { border-color: orange; }
          }
        </code>
