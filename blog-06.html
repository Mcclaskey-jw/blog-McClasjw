    <h1>Blog post for October 14th, 2021</h1>

    <p>This week I read about BOM or browser object model, though the W3 school site. BOM is all about using javascript
        to edit or manipulate the bowser screen. They have seven pages talking about the window, screen, location,
        history, navigator, popup alert, timing, and cookies. The pages I am talking about can be accessed<a
            href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_window.asp">here.</a></p>
    <p>
        The screen page talks about methods that you can use to open, close, move, and resize the current window, they
        also show examples of how you can get the current size of the window. The screen site discusses the width,
        height, avail width, avail height, color depth, and pixel depth. The avail height and depth are functions that
        return the users screen dimensions. The location page is about getting information about the location of the
        current site. The history page shows you how to get/force the previous and next web page. The Navigator page
        lets you show you if the cookies are enabled and what type of web browser the user is using. The popup and
        timing page shows us how to send alerts to the screen. The cookies page is all about getting and deleting
        cookies, as well as creating them.
    </p>

    <p>Below is the sample code to set a cookie:</p>
    <pre>
        <code class="language-CSS">
            function setCookie(cname, cvalue, exdays) {
                const d = new Date();
                d.setTime(d.getTime() + (exdays*24*60*60*1000));
                let expires = "expires="+ d.toUTCString();
                document.cookie = cname + "=" + cvalue + ";" + expires + ";path=/";
              }
        </code>
    </pre>
