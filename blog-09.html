    <h1>Blog post for November 11th, 2021</h1>

    <p>This week I as we are still working with react but going pushing on to our project 3 where we will take our project 2 endpoints and use them in react to build a front end.
        So this week unlike most weeks I changed things up and found an new article not from the W3school that discusses using endpoints in react.
        The link to the website I used can be accessed 
        <a href="https://jasonwatmore.com/post/2017/12/07/react-redux-jwt-authentication-tutorial-example">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The article I found by a guy called Markus Claus wrote a very indepth article about how to use my already existing endpoints and implement them with react.
        The article dicusses a lot of helpful details such as thunks, reducers, and actions. He does a good job explaining how we create these action functions in our actions.js
        which are then called by our reducer.js by the switch case on the different types of actions, sadly he very quickly glosses over how selkectors are used in this senario.
        Finally, he shows his new redux program that actually goes to the endpoint and retrieves the requested information and returns the information into the actions.js feilds to 
        then be processed. Sadly, his render is very different from what I have seen from my readings and it makes very little sense to me.
    </p>

    <p>Below is the sample of code from the forms article accessing the endpoint:</p>
    <pre>
        <code class="JavaScript">
    import {fetchProductsPending, fetchProductsSuccess, fetchProductsError} from 'actions';

    function fetchProducts() {
        return dispatch => {
            dispatch(fetchProductsPending());
            fetch('https://exampleapi.com/products')
            .then(res => res.json())
            .then(res => {
                if(res.error) {
                    throw(res.error);
                }
                dispatch(fetchProductsSuccess(res.products);
                return res.products;
            })
            .catch(error => {
                dispatch(fetchProductsError(error));
            })
        }
    }

    export default fetchProducts;
        </code>
