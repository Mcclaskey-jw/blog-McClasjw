    <p>
        This week we were asked to talk about how we would teach this CS 347. Fo me personlly I would keep the structure roughly the same,
        however I would to have two seperate classes on for "front-end" web developement, ie html and css, or a half semester course to learn
        these needed skill as they are difficult concepts but are needed for people who have never done web developement before.
        the other course would be all "back-end" web developement so endpoints and react, as these topic are difficult to understand and have a lot
        of moving parts. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For the part of how I think the class should be setup, I think the current system is great labs everyday in class where we try and learn
        how to implement the topics dicussed in a reading, however I would for the reading I would post all of the code so students can clearly see what is being 
        removed and added at each step. I would also post the solution to the lab so students could see what they were missing and messed up.
        As many of the labs would be showing students how to do the projects.
